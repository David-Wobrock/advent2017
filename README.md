# Advent of code 2017

## Motivation

Many programming languages exist for which I don't have enough time to look into.
I need an excuse to spend a small amount of time on some languages I have never tried.
But how? The advent of code offered good criteria for this purpose:

* Different problems (no monotony)
* Small problems (small amount of spent time)
* Language agnostic (try all the languages!)

## Circumstances

I managed to do the problems the day they came out until day 16.
Also, most problems took me less than 2 hours to do (apart from day 16 and 21 basically), taking into account that I used a language I never used before (and counting setting up the compiler/interpreter).

This, somehow, proves to me again that a programming language is a just tool, and that the main concepts and paradigms are similar in all languages. Or at least, in each language "family".
I mainly tried imperative and functional languages, since those are the most used.
I neglected logical programming on purpose because I already had the opportunity to work with Prolog to build an AI for a [game](https://github.com/Hexabinome/As_des_As).

I finished the calendar on January 1st 2018.

## That's it

Thank you very much [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for this awesome [advent project](https://adventofcode.com/2017/).
This is the first year I join the adventure, and I hope it will not be the last.

Merry Christmas!
